### About me

I'm Goodnews, some might call me Oluwaseun, I am a computer science undergraduate with interests in AI and software development such as mobile app development and web app development. Java is my first language but I have long forgotten the language 🥲, I write codes in python and Javascript now. Learning full stack development because why not  😎... though I prefer the back-end. Introvert but loves to talk. Yoruba native, Anime freak, good music 🎵, and tvshows(The big bang theory 🐐).
